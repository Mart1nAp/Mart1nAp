Hi. 
 Github

I am a passionate full stack developer and a software engineer from Colombia. My passion for software is based on dreaming up ideas and making them come true through elegant interfaces. I make sure the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build are exellent. I am also an open-source enthusiast. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love their emphasis on collaboration.
